        <h2>Coinbase</h2>
        <p><strong>Software Engineer</strong></p>
        <p>Jan 2022 - Mar 2023 · 1 yr 3 mos</p>
        <p>London, England, United Kingdom</p>
        <p>My most memorable experience as a software engineer was joining as an early member of the Coinbase Prime team, which is responsible for managing storage for institutional customers of their cryptocurrency. I was heavily involved in the architecture and development of the high-performance internal crypto trading backend and external public APIs. I also designed and built the authentication login component.</p>
        <p>The best part was that I had the chance to work in London and spent half a year there working for this company. It was a tough environment as we had very strict deadlines, and the cryptocurrency industry was changing rapidly, but I learned a lot of backend and security-related skills during my time there.</p>
        <p>This platform now serves over 5,000 institutions with a collective $40 billion in assets under management.</p>

        <p>May 2021 - Jan 2022 · 9 mos</p>
        <p>Seattle, Washington, United States</p>
        <p>The team I was in worked on an AI-powered travel agent developed using Java Spring Boot for Expedia's backend. The travel agent chatbot is now used by over 45 million users, but at that time, it was still in the beta version. I focused on testing and QA-related work, from writing integration tests to end-to-end testing (e.g., interacting with the AI agent by actual phone call).</p>

        <p>It was fun to be part of a large software project, though at times it felt a bit monotonous. However, I learned a lot about QA principles and gained valuable experience working in a big tech company.</p>

        <h2>Ponycody</h2>
        <p><strong>Software Engineer</strong></p>
        <p>Feb 2020 - Feb 2021 · 1 yr 1 mo</p>
        <p>California, United States · On-site</p>
        <p>Co-developed an online coding platform with three other engineers, scaling it from 0 to over 5,000 users. The platform was designed for both students and teachers, allowing students to run and test their code, while teachers could assign and review homework. It also featured functionalities like drag-and-drop for student submissions, enabling users to build their own project collections, leave comments, and earn points through an in-platform store. The frontend was built using React.js, and the backend was implemented with Node.js, all in JavaScript, using a NoSQL database for storage. We deployed the platform on Alibaba Cloud.</p>
        <p>It was a rewarding journey, starting from scratch and growing to thousands of users. While we didn’t always follow best practices—like having no CI/CD pipeline, staging environment, or proper branching (everything was pushed directly to master!)—it was a great learning experience. I gained many valuable skills in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and development during this time, balancing my dual role as a teacher and developer.</p>
        <p>I was also the coding teacher for 12-year-olds at the time, which was an interesting experience, as I was both a "user" and a "developer" of the platform. I used it during my lectures and had direct conversations with parents (our customers), gathering valuable feedback and insights from them.</p>
